# askdotmd
 chatgpt in your vscode -- stop being distracted when you open up your browser and do LLM chat in your editor

Set your preffered LLM provider & the corresponding API key in VSCode settings.

## How to use
- cd into project root
- `touch ask.md` 
  - it will work with any file, but it was designed to be separate from your actual codebase
- add prompt to file
- `ctrl+shift+l` for whole file
- or select a chunk of text and do the same

## Issues/PRs
Are welcome! I don't love JS/TS nor writing extensions, but I thought this was useful and worth doing. Any bugs, recommendations, or changes would be great.
