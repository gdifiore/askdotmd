 chatgpt in your vscode -- stop being distracted when you open up your browser and do LLM chat in your editor

Saw this in a [@yacineMTB](https://twitter.com/yacineMTB) stream, he said he wouldn't release it, so I made it.

Probably no support for other closed-source LLMs like Claude, but local LLM support coming.

Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.

### How to use
- cd into project root
- touch `ask.md`
- add prompt to file
- `ctrl+shift+l`
