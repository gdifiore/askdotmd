 chatgpt in your vscode -- stop being distracted when you open up your browser and do LLM chat in your editor

Saw this in a [@yacineMTB](https://twitter.com/yacineMTB) stream, he said he wouldn't release it, so I made it.

Set your preffered LLM provider in VSCode settings.

### How to use
- cd into project root
- `touch ask.md`
- add prompt to file
- `ctrl+shift+l` for whole file
- or select a chunk of text and do the same
